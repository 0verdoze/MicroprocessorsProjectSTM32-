# Project that i was assigned for Microprocessors class (STM32)

Project contained of 3 steps
 - implement communication with PC
 - design and implement protocol for communication
 - implement functionality, for it was PWM signal generation

All of the above is implented under Projekt and proto_cpp directories \
Almost all of the code in Projekt and proto_cpp is written in C++ (with the exception of CubeIDE code)

Additionally i reimplemented this protocol in Rust, and made a UI for simpler communication with the device
